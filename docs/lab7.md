# Lab 7: Verifying Your Custom Component Using System Console and `/dev/mem`

## Overview
Fought with GNU and the AUR to install the arm cross compiler, linker, and standard libraries, which took like 24 hours to build on my computer. Then I created a c program to interface with the devmem as provided in the lab handout. Finally the working lab 6 code was converted to a raw binary file to configure the FPGA fabric on boot.
