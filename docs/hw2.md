### Instead of writing the same thing I decided to write this. 

**This is some bold text in theory** 

_This has been Italicized_

> This is a block qoute in GH markdown format. WOW! 
>
>Going to a second line is also possible with this syntax when you add line breaks

> [!CAUTION]
> This doesn't render quite right on the markdown preview extension for VS Code. 

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

``` C
