# Homework 10 RGB LED Controller in VHDL 

## Overview
This homework builds off of HW-9, using the PWM generator to control the color of an RGB LED. This was ported to an avalon HPS interface to allow for controlling the PWM period and duty cycle. The period is fixed for each color channel and the duty cycle can be set per channel through each register. 

The registers are as follows:

- Base Address: 0x00850B0
- Offset 0x0 PWM period
- Offset 0x4 Red channel duty cycle
- Offset 0x8 Green channel duty cycle
- Offset 0xC Blue channel duty cycle

## Deliverables

For the RGB LED to blend colors evenly, it is important that each channel is set to the same base brightness. This was achieved through placing resistors in series with each channel of the LED. The calculations for this are below. 

### Voltage calculations
Target Voltage per channel
- GPIO Pin voltage: 3.3v, current limit 20mA
- Red: 2.0-2.2v
- Green: 3.0-3.3v
- Blue: 3.0 -3.3v

$$ Through Ohm's Law: V = IR\\
R_{red} = (3.3-2.2)v/20mA = 55\Omega\\
R_{green} = (3.3 - 3.0)v/20mA = 15\Omega\\
R_{blue} = R_{green}
$$
